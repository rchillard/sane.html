# Encryption

You may want to occasionally create a simple webpage and host it somewhere on the internet for someone to preview, but it may include semi-sensitive data, which you'd rather keep private.  In that case, it can be onerous to setup a form of authentication and exchange credentials.

[StatiCrypt](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt) gives you a CLI to password protect a static HTML page.
