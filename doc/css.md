## sane.css

sane.css is a stylesheet that normalizes behavior in modern browsers while providing sane defaults. This combines the idea of a basic boilerplate, a CSS reset, and sane defaults. Using a stylesheet like sane.css drives consistency, but it can also have added benefits. Benefits such as built in protection for inaccessible images.

sane.css combines features from [HTML 5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/main.css), (Normalize CSS)[https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css], and the [Modern CSS Reset](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/modern-css-reset):

* A default color, font-size, and line-height (1.4) on the HTML element
* Setting box-sizing rules to border-box on everything
* Fixing vertical alignment of multimedia elements (audio, canvas, iframe, img, svg, video)
* Incorrect H1 sizes inside of section and articles elements
* Various font adjustments for elements like b, strong, code, kbd, samp
* Form and button margin and font size adjustments
* Body element will always fill the screen and text rendering will be optimized for speed
* A media query for prefers-reduced-motion that removes animation, transition, and scroll behavior
