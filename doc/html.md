# HTML

sane.html provides two `html` pages:

* [`index.html`](#indexhtml) - a default HTML skeleton that should form the
  basis of all pages on your website
* `404.html` - a placeholder 404 error page

## `index.html`

### The `no-js` Class

The `no-js` class is provided in order to allow you to more easily and
explicitly add custom styles based on whether JavaScript is disabled (`.no-js`)
or enabled (`.js`). Using this technique also helps [avoid the
FOUC](https://www.paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/).

### Language Attribute

Please consider specifying the language of your content by adding a
[value](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry)
to the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` as in this example:

```html
<html class="no-js" lang="en">
```

### The order of the `<title>` and `<meta>` tags

The charset declaration (`<meta charset="utf-8">`) must be included completely
within the [first 1024 bytes of the
document](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#charset)
and should be specified as early as possible (before any content that could be
controlled by an attacker, such as a `<title>` element) in order to avoid a
potential [encoding-related security
issue](https://code.google.com/archive/p/doctype-mirror/wikis/ArticleUtf7.wiki).

### Meta Description

The `description` meta tag provides a short description of the page. In some
situations this description is used as a part of the snippet shown in the search
results.

```html
<meta name="description" content="This is a description">
```

Google's [Create good meta
descriptions](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35624?hl=en#meta-descriptions)
documentation has useful tips on creating an effective description.

### Mobile Viewport

There are a few different options that you can use with the [`viewport` meta
tag](https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dkx3qtm_22dxsrgcf4 "Viewport and
Media Queries - The Complete Idiot's Guide"). You can find out more in [the MDN
Web
Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag).
sane.html comes with a simple setup that strikes a good balance for
general use cases.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

If you want to take advantage of edge-to-edge displays of iPhone X/XS/XR you
can do so with additional viewport parameters. [Check the WebKit
blog](https://webkit.org/blog/7929/designing-websites-for-iphone-x/) for
details.

### Open Graph Metadata

The [Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/) allows you to define the way your
site is presented when referenced on third party sites and applications
(Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). The protocol provides a series of meta elements
that define the details of your site. The required attributes define the title,
preview image, URL, and [type](https://ogp.me/#types) (e.g., video, music,
website, article).

``` html
<meta property="og:title" content="">
<meta property="og:type" content="">
<meta property="og:url" content="">
<meta property="og:image" content="">
```

In addition to these four attributes there are many more attributes you can use
to add more richness to the description of your site. This just represents the
most basic implementation.

### Web App Manifest

The web app manifest is a simple JSON file that allows you to control how your
app appears on a device's home screen, what it looks like when it launches in
that context and what happens when it is launched. This allows for much greater control over the UI of a saved site or web app on a mobile device.

It's linked to from the HTML as follows:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="site.webmanifest">
```
You should fill this file out with [more information about your site or
application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)

### Favicons and Touch Icon

The shortcut icons should be put in the root directory of your site.
`favicon.ico` is automatically picked up by browsers if it's placed in the root.
sane.html comes with a default set of icons (include favicon and one
Apple Touch Icon) that you can use as a baseline to create your own.

### The Content Area

The central part of the boilerplate template is pretty much empty. This is
intentional.
